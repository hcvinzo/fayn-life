# Tailwind CSS Version Fix

## Issue
The project was initially set up with Tailwind CSS v4 (latest), which has breaking changes and requires a different PostCSS plugin setup.

## Fix Applied
Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 for compatibility with the current Next.js setup.

## What Was Changed

### Dependencies
```bash
# Removed
tailwindcss@4.x

# Installed
tailwindcss@3.4.1
postcss@8.4.35
autoprefixer@10.4.18
```

### Configuration Files
- `postcss.config.js` - Uses standard Tailwind v3 PostCSS plugin
- `tailwind.config.ts` - No changes needed (compatible with v3)

## Verification
✅ Server starts without PostCSS errors
✅ All Tailwind classes work correctly
✅ Dark mode configuration working
✅ Custom theme colors applied

## Future Migration to Tailwind v4

When you're ready to migrate to Tailwind v4, follow these steps:

1. Update dependencies:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/postcss@latest
```

2. Update `postcss.config.js`:
```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}
  }
}
```

3. Update `tailwind.config.ts` according to v4 migration guide:

## Current Status
✅ Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 - Working perfectly
✅ All features functional
✅ No errors or warnings
